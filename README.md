# Rails Deployment Example

This is the test app used for validating that the configuration generated by <https://github.com/TalkingQuickly/capistrano-cookbook> is working correctly.

This approach to deployment is covered in detail in [this tutorial](https://www.talkingquickly.co.uk/deploying-rails-to-a-vps-with-capistrano-and-systemd) as well as in the book [Reliably Deploying Rails Applications](https://leanpub.com/deploying_rails_applications).
